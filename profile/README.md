## Plastilin

**Plastilin Ltd.** is a company that collaborates with major agro-holdings to optimize the selection of agricultural plants. We achieve this through the use of genome editing technologies and the automation of genotype and phenotype analysis. Our primary goal is to breed new plant varieties that significantly surpass existing ones in terms of yield, nutritional value (protein content, oil content, etc.), resilience to climate change, and pathogens. One of our focus areas is analyzing genetic information about varieties, and its correlation with phenotypes, devising recommendatory schemes for conducting the breeding process, and automating it through the development of our platform.
